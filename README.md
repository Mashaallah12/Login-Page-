I created a **Login Page** using **React** to practice the concepts of **useState** and **props**. The page includes input fields for the username and password, with **useState** used to manage and update the state of the input values as the user types. 

**Props** are utilized to pass data between components, such as passing the state of the form to other child components for validation or rendering error/success messages based on user input.

This project helped reinforce the understanding of managing state in functional components with **useState**, as well as how to pass data between components using **props** to create a dynamic and interactive login interface.
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
